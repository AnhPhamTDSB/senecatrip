Grrah

[Chorus]
You thought I was feelin' you? (Nah)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie, I get what I want, like
You thought I was feelin’ you? (Nah, thought I was feelin' you?)
That nigga a munch
Nigga a eater, he ate it for lunch
Bitch, I'm a baddie, I get what I want, like (Get what I want, like)

[Verse 1]
Bitches ain't bad, let's keep it a bean
Know they be mad that I be on the scene
Ass too fat, can't fit in no jeans
You was my stitch, but it's not what it seem
I got that wetty, I'm keepin’ it clean
Fuckin’ with niggas that's totin’ a beam (Grrah)
Sayin' you love me, but what do you mean? (Grrah)
Pretty as fuck and he like that I'm mean
Baddest bitch out, you shittin' me? (Shittin’ me)
If you ain't a baddie, can't sit with me (Sit with mе)
I swear that these bitchеs my mini-me's (Mini-me, grrah, grrah)
He wanna sex, niggas be dreamin'
I'm from the X, niggas be schemin'
I'm on they necks, they is not breathin'
Thumbin' a check, blow it in Neiman's
